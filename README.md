# LeBotTel #

## Abstract ##
LeBotTel is an easy to use python package to create your own Telegram bots for different use cases. For details how to use this package refer to the [Quick Start][] section. 

## Name ##
The name LeBotTel is combined from "Le Cun", "RoBot" and "Telegram". The "Le" in the name comes from Yann LeCun, to honor his work on neural networks (has nothing to do with this project, but he is a great scientist and pionier in the field of neural networks (LeNet)). What has this bot to do with neural networks? We want to use this bot to log the training of neural networks. "Bot" comes from RoBot, because this is what the goal of this project is. And "Tel" comes from Telegram, because its a bot for Telegram. The "Pi" in our logo represents looks similar to the "tT" in "LeBotTel" and stands for the used Programming Language Python.
